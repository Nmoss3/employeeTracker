## Dependancies
 - MySQL
 - console.table
 - Inquirer
 
 ## Description 
 
 In this challenge I was to successfully create a database and allow a user to interact with inquirer prompts to add, delete or update information within the database.
 I created a database close to home which included tables for departments of a hotel along with different roles within each department along with employees within those roles and departments.
 
 ## Issues
 Some time inbetween testing I ran into a inquirer package error that would not allow me to continue testing. I uninstalled all packages and reinstalled them to continue to get the same error and I could not figure out how to fix it in time since it was not code that I have written that needed to be fixed. The console showed it was within the node_modules.

 ## Conclusion
 
 I will have to return to this project at a different time and try again. I am unsure at this time howt to fix this issue.
